## TO DO
Below is a list with some suggested features:

- Implement an option to reload the page in case of error or if the user wants to reload the movie information.
- Implement a movie rating feature with stars because the current implementation with likes is just a Mock (as per my question, the challenge print showed the list screen and not the movie and unlike the list the movie doesn't have a like feature but rather an evaluation based in stars).

## comments
Below is a list with some comments that I had during the development:

- I removed the buttons from the footer because the screen isn't the list.
- As per my conversation with Maria from Inspire, I replicated the print screen with the information of a specific film, I needed to change some features and layout because of this issue.

## Requirements

- iOS 13.6+
- Xcode 11.6
